When is the bus coming?
-----------------------
This project was created in 24 hours during the national day of civic hacking.

The project was done completely in Google Script.  You will have to copy/paste
these files into Google Script to get it working (this was an export).

A user can text the route+stop number to get the next bus arrival, all bus arrivals,
or setup a reminder.
